# M2 build order — dependency-ordered tracks

Orchestration breakdown of **ADR-0003** (Accepted — the ratified M2 spec). M2 ports
gc's **work-convergence** state machine into a new `grid_reconciler` package that consumes
`grid_controller`'s `GraphEvent` stream + `GraphSnapshot` (M1) and actuates through bd.
Tracks run in parallel where inputs allow; ⊣ marks a hard dependency. AI decisions made
en route: ADR-0000 amendments, never silent. Conventions: CLAUDE.md. Source spec on disk:
`~/development/com.gastownhall/gascity/internal/convergence/` (~4.1k LOC non-test, 21 test
files = the conformance oracle, ADR-0003 D7).

**Scope (ADR-0003 D1):** work convergence ONLY. Topology/session reconciliation is M3/M4.

## Track 0 — serial preconditions

1. **`grid_reconciler` scaffold**: pubspec (depends on `grid_controller`, freezed/riverpod/
   test), add to the root pub workspace + melos. Green: `melos bootstrap` + `dart analyze`.
2. **Wisp-pour verb spike** (ADR-0003 D4) — ✅ **RESOLVED** (2026-06-12, ADR-0000 **A15/A16**;
   artifact `packages/grid_reconciler/tool/wisp_pour_spike.sh`). The pour IS offline-reproducible
   and atomic via **`bd cook <formula> --mode=runtime` (resolve) → `bd create --graph <plan>
   --ephemeral` (pour)**, the plan's root node carrying `parent_id`→convergence bead +
   `metadata.idempotency_key = converge:{beadID}:iter:{N}` (the faithful CLI analog of gc's
   in-process `molecule.Cook`; `bd mol wisp` is rejected — no parent/key/file surface).
   **Idempotency is the_grid's own job** (`FindByIdempotencyKey` = scan the root's children for
   the key metadata over the snapshot — no bd primitive). **A16 caveat:** `bd batch` cannot carry
   `metadata` or `mol wisp` (allowed update keys: status/priority/title/assignee), so transition
   metadata uses `bd update --metadata`; crash-safety rests on the write-ordering + idempotency
   invariants, not batch atomicity. **Touches ratified ADR-0003 D4** → pending in ADR-0000, not
   silently edited into D4.

## Parallel tracks (after Track 0.1)

- **Track A — convergence domain + metadata codec** ✅ **DONE** (2026-06-13, 240 tests; design
  pinned in ADR-0000 **A17–A19**) *(pure; the contract everything binds to)*:
  `ConvergenceState {creating, active, waiting_manual, waiting_trigger, terminated}` (⚠ snake_case
  wire) with a total-decode `ConvergenceStateReading {notAdopted | known | unrecognized}`;
  the typed `convergence.*` metadata codec — **31 keys, not 16** (A18 corrects the count; the
  build order's original list omitted `pending_next_wisp` + 14 others, several invariant-load-
  bearing; source `metadata.go:12-44`), each field a `FieldReading {value|absent|malformed}`,
  unknown keys preserved verbatim so `encode(decode(m))==m` (A13 pattern); `GateMode`/`GateOutcome`/
  `GateTimeoutAction`/`TriggerMode` closed enums, `TerminalReason`/`WaitingReason`/`Verdict` open
  extension types (gc passes them through unvalidated); Go-scalar parity (`GoDuration`, `goAtoi`…)
  pinned to go1.26 output. Sealed `ReconcilerAction` (the 7 ADR-0003 wire actions + carrier
  variants `pourSpeculative`/`persistGateOutcome`/`repairIteration`/`failed`/`requeue`) — every
  action is data, exposing its gc ordered-write sequence as derived getters; `ReducerEvent` is the
  `reduce()` input. `Convergence`/`Wisp` projections over the snapshot (reusing grid_controller's
  `ProjectionResult`; `Wisp.subtreeIds` post-order = burn order, `speculativeNodes`,
  `findByIdempotencyKey`) + providers (ADR-0002 D2: `convergencesProvider`,
  `convergencesByStateProvider` keyed by the *reading*, `activeWispProvider`).
- **Track B — the pure state machine** ✅ **DONE** (2026-06-13, ~110 tests; design ADR-0000 **A22**)
  ⊣ A: `ConvergenceReducer.reduce(Convergence, ReducerEvent, GraphSnapshot) → ReduceResult` (ordered
  action list + `primary` getter), switch-matched + exhaustive, **ported from the Go** (handler.go
  9-step + operator/trigger handlers) per A19 not the incomplete table. Gate eval is a **two-reduce
  phase split** (fresh: `[pourSpeculative, evaluateGate]` → Track D runs it → re-enter via
  `gateEvaluated` → `persistGateOutcome` + transition; replay skips phase 1; manual short-circuits
  in one reduce). `RetryHandler` + trigger-gated CREATE are the create/actuator surface, NOT reduce
  transitions (A22). **Preserves all 7 invariants verbatim** (Track A's ordered-write getters encode
  invariant 2 incl. `last_processed_wisp` after `CloseBead` on terminal paths). Pure (no I/O/clock),
  exhaustively unit-tested against the transliterated conformance inventories.
- **Track C — recovery / full-reconcile pass** ⊣ A, B: ports `reconcile.go` recovery paths
  (state `""`→adopt/pour wisp 1 · `creating`→terminate · `terminated`-but-open→close+re-emit ·
  `waitingManual`→re-emit hold + repair markers · `waitingTrigger`→no-op unless terminal ·
  `active`→recover/replay/pour). Runs at startup + as a low-frequency backstop over the snapshot.
- **Track D — gate execution** ✅ **DONE** (2026-06-13, ~105 tests; design ADR-0000 **A23**)
  ⊣ A: `GateRunnerService` over an injectable `ProcessRunner` seam (fake in unit tests, real
  subprocess in integration-tagged) returning a closed `ProcessRunOutcome`; gc's env contract
  verbatim (`GC_BEAD_ID, GC_ITERATION, GC_WISP_ID, GC_AGENT_VERDICT, GC_ARTIFACT_DIR, GC_CITY_RUNTIME_DIR,
  GC_CONTROL_DISPATCHER_TRACE_DEFAULT`, durations, paths); outcome by exit code (0=pass / non-zero=fail /
  deadline=timeout / pre-exec=error), parent-cancel via `CancellationToken`; timeout actions
  `iterate`/`retry`(≤3)/`manual`/`terminate`; bounded stdout/stderr capture; **symlink/traversal
  containment** ported + escape-tested (A23 — the trusted-roots guard is built but wired by Track E/G
  at the exec call site). Agent-verdict channel is read, not reinterpreted.
- **Track E — actuator** ⊣ A, B, grid_controller: executes `ReconcilerAction`s' ordered writes
  (A17 getters). **Not via `bd batch`** (A16: batch carries no `metadata`, no `delete`, no `mol`/
  `--graph`) — transitions are sequenced calls ordered by the write-ordering invariant: metadata
  via `bd update --metadata <json>` (merges; works on closed beads — A15 correction), **burn** via
  `bd delete` post-order subtree (NOT close — A16), **pour** via `bd cook --mode=runtime` +
  `bd create --graph` **PERSISTENT — no `--ephemeral`** (A15 correction: gc's iterations are
  committed `issues` beads), idempotency pre-checked by a **live** probe immediately before pour
  (snapshot scan is the fast/shadow path only — duplicate-pour freshness, A17). Requires extending
  grid_controller's `BdCliService` with `update(--metadata)`, `create(--graph)`, `delete`, and a
  `cook` resolve. The `Actuator` interface is the seam (fake in tests; ADR-0003 D4).
- **Track F — ready-work SQL port + differential harness** ✅ **DONE** (2026-06-13, +26 offline +
  hermetic differential green; design + correction ADR-0000 **A24**) ⊣ grid_controller
  (DoltQueryService): ported `issueops/ready_work.go`'s predicate (status∈{open}, `is_blocked`=0 over
  {blocks, conditional-blocks, waits-for}, `defer_until`, ephemeral, molecule-exclusion A14, sort
  policy) to SQL over the pool via a `runReadTransaction` (START TRANSACTION READ ONLY) seam.
  ⚠ **A24 correction:** `bd ready` applies **NO conditional-blocks failure-keyword semantics** —
  `blocked.go:29` treats conditional-blocks identically to blocks (`IsFailureClose` has zero
  non-test call sites); the keyword set is ported as inert data. **Three-half differential** (D5):
  hermetic `bd init` oracle witnesses (everywhere) · hermetic `dolt sql-server` SQL-port==`bd ready`
  on seeded fixtures · live read-only over `tg`, self-skipping without `GC_DOLT_PASSWORD` and never
  seeding the gc-managed server (partition rule). `bd ready` stays the oracle + fallback.
- **Track G — reconciler runtime + shadow mode** ⊣ B, C, D, E: wires the `GraphEvent` stream →
  per-bead **serialized** processing (invariant 7) → state machine (B) → actuator (E) + the
  periodic full reconcile (C); Riverpod providers for convergence projections. **Freshness (A17):**
  events are evaluated against a **write-through post-actuation overlay**, never the raw snapshot
  (else a stale snapshot re-fires `triggerPassed` → duplicate pour); the operator-stop **drain**
  is re-enqueued as `OperatorStopEvent(postDrain: true)` behind the synthesized `wispClosed`
  pipeline (A19). **Dirty signal (A21):** `SELECT @@<db>_working` already flips on dolt-ignored
  wisp writes, so the SQL probe alone catches gc's cross-workspace wisp closes (the file-watcher
  cannot) — no wisp-specific augmentation needed; treat it as sufficient-not-necessary (structural
  diff is authority). **Shadow mode (ADR-0003 D6, strictly read-only):** compute every transition
  gc would make, diff against what gc actually did, report divergence — no writes. gc's convergence
  wisps are persistent `issues` beads (A15 correction), so shadow reads them directly. Coexistence
  partition enforced (disjoint bead/rig set; ownership marker).
- **Track H — conformance suite** ⊣ B, C, D: transliterate gc's convergence tests into Dart —
  `handler_test.go` (9-step), `reconcile_test.go` (recovery), `manual_test.go`, `trigger_test.go`,
  `gate_test.go`, `hybrid_test.go`. The executable spec (ADR-0003 D7).
- **Track I — convergence fixture capture** *(just-in-time; DATA GAP)*: capture a real
  `convergence + gate + wisp + molecule + step + needs` subgraph and pin it (folds in A13's
  molecule/step gap). Validates the Track-A metadata codec against reality. **Blocked on live
  convergence activity** — the live city currently holds ZERO convergence/gate/wisp beads
  (export histogram = session/task/bug), so until a convergence runs, A's codec is validated
  synthetically + against the Go tests only. Source for synthetic fixtures: gc's own test
  fixtures under `convergence/*_test.go`.

## Dependency spine

`0 → A → {B, D, F} → {C, E} → G → H` · I just-in-time.

## Definition of done (ADR-0003 + PDR §5 M2 row)

1. State machine + recovery **conformance-green** against the transliterated gc suite (D7, H).
2. Ready-work SQL **differential-equal** to `bd ready` across all scenarios (D5, F).
3. Gate subprocess contract verified — env, exit-code→outcome, timeout actions, containment (D).
4. **Shadow mode** runs read-only against live convergence traffic and reports divergence vs gc
   (D2/D6) — the live half gated on convergence activity + `GC_DOLT_PASSWORD` (degrades like M1
   criteria 2/4; mechanism + replay-against-fixtures testable offline now).
5. Coexistence partition respected: disjoint bead set, shadow never writes (D6).
6. Every en-route AI decision sits in ADR-0000 as pending.

## Known gaps carried in (do not let these block the pure core)

- **No pinned convergence fixture** (Track I) — build B/C/D/H against gc's Go tests now; pin a real
  subgraph when a convergence runs.
- **Shadow acceptance** needs live convergence traffic (none today) + dolt creds.
- ~~**bd pour verb** (Track 0.2) may not be offline-reproducible~~ — **resolved** (A15): it is, via
  `cook`+`create --graph`. The `Actuator` seam stays for testability (fake in unit tests), not for an
  offline gap. Track E must extend `grid_controller`'s `BdCliService` with a `--metadata` update path,
  a `--graph --ephemeral` pour path, and a `cook --mode=runtime` resolve (A16 "Affects: code").
